# Libraries

Some third-party libraries are used to generate the html report
- [Chart.js v2.9.4](https://www.chartjs.org)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [dismissible](https://github.com/brookesb91/dismissible)

The reports works in offline mode. The libraries are not loaded from internet, they are hardcoded.
