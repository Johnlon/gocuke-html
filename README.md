gocuke-html
===========

This library written in Go provides beautiful html reports.

**gocuke-html** is a fork of [gocure](https://gitlab.com/rodrigoodhin/gocure) that has been customised to address certain problems and to add new features.

For example gocuke-html is intended to fully support the standard Cucumber Json file format.

History
===

Issues raised against gocure are not getting any attention, so I assume it is unmaintained.

Gocure appears to be a reimplentation of the UI design of the earlier NodeJS project [Cucumber-Html-Reporter](https://github.com/gkushang/cucumber-html-reporter).
